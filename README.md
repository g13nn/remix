## Description

Maizzle REMIX is a showcase of email redesign experiments.

It provides examples of using [Maizzle](https://github.com/maizzle/maizzle) to rebuild really good looking emails from scratch.

## Purpose

The goal is to show examples of how you can use Maizzle to build great HTML emails, and how an optimized workflow can help you stay organized and automate many tedious tasks, such as writing inline CSS or working with a design system for email.

The goal is definitely _not_ to tell anyone how they should code their emails.

## Guidelines

These are the guidelines that any Maizzle REMIX needs to follow.

#### Privacy & Security

- Any sensitive data should be replaced with dummy data

- Experiments should only be made on layouts that are either publicly accessible (web versions, [CodePen](https://codepen.io/maizzle), [RGE](https://reallygoodemails.com/) or [curated.email](https://curated.email/)), or that you have subscribed to and received

- Images must be directly referenced from the online version of the original. When unavailable, they will be replaced with placeholders from an online service

#### Built to resemble the original

REMIXes should be as close as possible to the original's layout, color palette, and content.

#### Responsive-only

Yes, [Hybrid](https://www.google.com/search?q=hybrid+email+coding&oq=hybrid+email+coding) works where Responsive doesn't, but it's becoming more and more of an edge case, and it's pretty limiting. Considering the trend is to support `@media` queries in mobile email clients, Maizzle REMIX will only focus on the vast majority of cases, where responsive _is_ supported.
