## Description

Maizzle REMIX is a showcase of email redesign experiments.

It provides examples of using [Maizzle](https://github.com/maizzle/maizzle) to rebuild really good looking emails from scratch.

## Purpose

The goal is to show examples of how you can use Maizzle to build great HTML emails, and how an optimized workflow can help you stay organized and automate many tedious tasks, such as writing inline CSS or working with a design system for email.

The goal is definitely _not_ to tell anyone how they should code their emails.

### Privacy & Security

- Any sensitive data will be replaced with dummy data

- Experiments only use emails that are either publicly accessible (web versions, [CodePen](https://codepen.io/maizzle), [RGE](https://reallygoodemails.com/) or [curated.email](https://curated.email/)), or that you can subscribe to

- Images are directly referenced from the online version of the original, if available. Otherwise they will be replaced with placeholders from an online service

### Responsive-only

Yes, [Hybrid coding](https://www.google.com/search?q=hybrid+email+coding&oq=hybrid+email+coding) works where `@media` queries aren't supported, but this is becoming more and more of an edge case, and it's also pretty limiting in terms of layout complexity.

Considering the trend is to support `@media` queries in mobile email clients, Maizzle REMIX will only focus on the vast majority of cases, where responsive design through `@media` queries _is_ supported.
