## Description

Maizzle REMIX is a showcase of email redesign experiments.

It provides examples of using [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com/) to rebuild really good looking emails from scratch.

## Purpose

The goal is to show the importance of clean code in email development, and how an optimized workflow (like Maizzle!) can help you stay organized and automate many tedious tasks, such as writing inline CSS or working based on a design system.

The goal is definitely _not_ to tell anyone how they should code their emails. Use as inspiration, not as 'best practice'.

## Rules

These are the rules that any Maizzle REMIX experiment will follow.

#### Privacy & Security

- Any sensitive data, such as private content or links, will be replaced with dummy data.

- Experiments will only be made on layouts that are publicly accessible (web versions, [CodePen](https://codepen.io/maizzle), [RGE](https://reallygoodemails.com/) or [curated.email](https://curated.email/)).

- Images must be directly referenced from the online version of the original. When unavailable, they will be replaced with placeholders from an online service.

#### Built to resemble the original

Re-designs should be as close as possible to the original's layout, color palette, and content.

#### Responsive-only

Yes, [Hybrid](https://www.google.com/search?q=hybrid+email+coding&oq=hybrid+email+coding) works where Responsive doesn't, but it's becoming more and more of an edge case, and it's pretty limiting. Considering the trend is to support `@media` queries in mobile email clients, Maizzle REMIX will only focus on the vast majority of cases, where responsive _is_ supported.
